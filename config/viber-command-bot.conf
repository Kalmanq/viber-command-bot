# Viber Command Bot - bot configuration file
#
# Configuration block "Viber" is mandatory. It is used for configuring the

#
#   https://developers.viber.com/docs/api/python-bot-api/
#
# The mandatory configuration options are:
#
# authentication_token  - authentication token for the public Viber bot account
# name                  - bot name shown in the message
# avatar                - image URL for bot avatar
# webhook               - webhook URL of the bot
# notify_user_id        - user id who receives notifications from the bot
# trusted_user_ids      - list of user ids that are allowed to send messages
#                         to the bot
#
# Optional configuration options are:
#
# redis_channel         - name of the redis pubsub channel where the messages
#                         are also sent
# redis_host            - redis host used for message queue
# command_executor      - if set to True, other daemon takes care of the
#                         received messages through Redis pubsub
#
# Configuration block "Logging" specifies logging options:
#
# level                 - log level (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG);
#                         default is INFO

# file                  - log to file; default is no file
# stdout                - log to stdout (True, False); default False
#
# Commands for the bot are specified using configuration blocks with sections
# in a format "Command name". "name" is the command received from the client as
# "/name". Each command can have the following options:
#
# execute               - command to be executed by the bot through shell;
#                         as a security measure, bot is not able to use any
#                         information received from the user while executing
#                         the command
# output_format         - output format of the command: text (default), json, none
# help                  - text to be shown in "/help" command
