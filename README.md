# Project Viber

This is a small project to get familiar with Viber messaging service
(https://www.viber.com/).

These tools use Viber Python Bot API
(https://developers.viber.com/docs/api/python-bot-api/) to send and receive
messages.


## Viber command bot

**command_bot** is a simple Viber bot that receives commands from a trusted
Viber user. Bot executes the configured command and returns the answer.


## Send Viber message

**send_message.py** is a small Python script that can be used for sending
messages to a trusted Viber user that has subscribed to public Viber bot
account.
